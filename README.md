# Search Engine Simulator in C++

A search engine simulator built in **C++** that mimics the basic functionality of web search engines. This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate concepts of **data indexing, query processing, and ranking**, implemented using **data structures** such as hash tables, linked lists, and max heaps, with **ranking algorithms** like TF-IDF and BM25.

## Features

- Index a collection of documents or web pages  
- Search for keywords or phrases  
- Display search results ranked by relevance using **TF-IDF** and **BM25** algorithms  
- Support for **multiple queries** (sequential or batch processing)  
- Menu-driven or GUI interface for easy interaction  
- Demonstrates core search engine concepts (indexing, matching, ranking) using **hash tables, linked lists, and max heaps**
